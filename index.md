# Welcome to Dave's Github Page

This is just my personal space on Github to play around with the sites repo and highlight any repos I think might be useful. Really, if you're here, you're probably looking for something else. 

## Current Projects

- GA Sale Notification Android App
- Gnome 3 Applet (GA?) - Sales Alert
- City Weather Conversion Data
- Deeper insights (secret) 
- Content CRM (Secret)
- RSS reader with multi device subscription 
- Speedtest Chron & Grapher that triggers a Tracert to monitor connectivity degredation on weekends


### What's Coming

Not much at the moment to be honest. All porjects for summer have already kicked off in their individual repos and organization accounts.
