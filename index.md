## Welcome to Dave's Github Page

This is just my personal space on Github to play around with the sites repo and highlight any repos I think might be useful. Really, if you're here, you're probably looking for something else. 

### Markdown

This is just me playing around with Markdown for the moment. 

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/davedavis/davedavis.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
