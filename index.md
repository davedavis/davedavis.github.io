## Welcome to Dave's Github Page

This is just my personal space on Github to play around with the sites repo and highlight any repos I think might be useful. Really, if you're here, you're probably looking for something else. 

### Markdown

This is just me playing around with Markdown for the moment. 

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

Testing Jekyl build processes.

### What's Coming

Not much at the moment to be honest. All porjects for summer have already kicked off in their individual repos and organization accounts.
